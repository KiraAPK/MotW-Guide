            <p class="monster-description">An amphibious predator that does not use sound to lure its prey. Instead, it releases a potent, aerosolized neuro-agent from glands along its back. When inhaled near the water's edge, this chemical targets the auditory cortex and pleasure centers of the human brain, causing victims to *believe* they are hearing an irresistible sound or voice. This auditory hallucination compels them to walk into the water where the creature lies in ambush.</p>
