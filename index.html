            <p class="monster-description">An amphibious predator that does not use sound to lure its prey. Instead, it releases a potent, aerosolized neuro-agent from glands along its back. When inhaled near the water's edge, this chemical targets the auditory cortex and pleasure centers of the human brain, causing victims to *believe* they are hearing an irresistible sound or voice. This auditory hallucination compels them to walk into the water where the creature lies in ambush.</p>

            <p class="monster-description">A parasitic organism from a dimension where life propagates via psychic implantation. The adult form, a non-corporeal psychic entity, implants a larva into a human host (typically an infant). The larva does not replace the child but grows symbiotically, feeding on the host's bio-electric energy and psionic potential. The "changeling" is the original child, appearing sickly and withdrawn as its life force is siphoned away by the growing parasite.</p>

    <p class="monster-description">A gaunt, nocturnal hominid that has adapted to urban infiltration. It can contort its body to fit through extremely tight spaces, such as chimneys, air ducts, and plumbing chases. Its primary biological tool is the ability to generate a low-frequency infrasound, which it uses to induce feelings of dread, paranoia, and the sense of being watched in the inhabitants of a dwelling, effectively "tenderizing" its prey psychologically before it reveals itself.</p>

It can psionically influence and accelerate plant growth, and its skin is a bark-like camouflage covered in moss and lichen. It is the self-appointed guardian of its territory, using its abilities to lead intruders astray, trap them in overgrown thickets, or command animals to attack them. Its size and form seem to change depending on the height of the trees within its domain.</p>
