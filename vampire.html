<h1>VAMPIRE</h1>
<h3>Category(s): Vampiric, Humanoid</h3>
<p><a href= "index.html">Back</a></p>
</header>
<h3>Basic Information:</h3>
<p>Vampires are monsters that require a steady supply of blood, usually human, to sustain themselves. Vampires have above-average strength, speed, and reflexes, as well as other supernatural powers. Vampires cannot perform any sort of witchcraft.<br>
Danger Level: Moderate</p>
<h3>Lore:</h3>
<p>Vampires are typically sentient monsters unless they are of the undead variant. Their sentience is on a similar level to that of humans, but further testing on contained specimens will be required for certainty. Vampires will hunt alone or in pairs.<br>
Vampires emit hormones that null both a victim’s fight-or-flight response and pain. Experienced hunters will typically recognize this type of “mind control” as supernatural. Some vampires develop the ability to shift in regular animals, but there will always be defining characteristics to tie back to the humanoid form. The few vampires that can shapeshift gain the ability through their bloodline. The families of vampires that can shift have specific forms they will be able to take on.</p>
<h3>Subspecies:</h3>
<p>Living Vampire - Classic vampiric species: Living creature which can be warded off by holy items and killed as any normal organism can be; however, they will typically rise again as an undead variant.<br>
Undead Vampire - A risen vampire or a victim of an attack that now forms as a weaker variant. Undead vampires cannot stay in direct contact with sunlight and have lower functioning mental abilities, hence they are lesser threats. Can only be killed by wooden stakes.</p>
<h3>Habitats:</h3>
<p>Vampires typically hide amongst humans in urban cities, rural farms, and other places of varying levels of human population. As vampires do not feed only on humans, they can survive in places without much human life.</p>
<h3>Hunting:</h3>
<li>When hunting a vampire, it is best to ensure the target is both isolated and unsuspecting. An injured vampire can easily flee by several means, particularly shapeshifting.</li>
<li>Regardless of the variant of vampire, always carry a wooden stake to ensure a permanent death. Crucifixes and garlic flowers can also stall a vampire from feeding on the hunter, but may also alert them to the intent to kill.</li>
<li>If a hunter is aware of a vampire’s attempt to perform mental dominion, the hunter can fight the effects.</li>
<li>Always attack the vampire’s limbs if a quick life-ending blow is not possible. Once the vampire has been killed, use a stake to prevent any returns to “life”. </li>
