        The organisms residing throughout the United States of America range in viciousness and require control and study in order to protect the safety of citizens. A guide to the various creatures that have been discovered will be provided to all government-funded and approved agencies for the containment of monsters.

    <section id="hunting-guide">
        Humanoid - Any organism sharing a form similar to humans: Bipedal, human-like faces, or any other feature overlap. Humanoid monsters tend to be difficult to capture.<br>
        Beastial - Any organism sharing a form similar to typical “animals”. Beastial monsters have a tendency to be the most dangerous by pure strength.<br>
        Shapeshifting - Any organism that can change form, this is an “ability” more than a true category and will have much overlap with other categories, leading it to act more as a sub-label.<br>
        Carnivorous - Bloodsuckers, flesh-eaters, or any other organism requiring the killing of humans to survive. This is a sub-label with overlap onto other categories.<br>
        Neutral - Monsters who do not directly/intentionally harm humans unprovoked. Not rare, as some monsters can be dangerous after being agitated or threatened.
